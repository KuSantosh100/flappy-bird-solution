An AI that plays popular flappy bird! AI learns to play the game Flappy Bird using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. The project involves training a neural network through a genetic algorithm to improve its performance over multiple generations, simulating the process of natural selection. The project was done using Python and the NEAT library without referring to existing codebases. Through trial and error, the AI improves its performance, eventually mastering the game by jumping at optimal times to avoid obstacles. The entire project was coded in Python using libraries such as ```neat-python``` and ```Pygame``` to model the game environment and AI interaction.

# Instructions
Simply run *flappy_bird.py* and watch an AI start training itself to play the game of flappy bird!

## How To Use :-
Insatll all the dependencies present in the requirements.txt

``` pip install -r requirements.txt  ```

Run the program then by *flappy_bird.py*

``` run flappy_bird.py  ```
